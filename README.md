# Simple browser-based drawing tool on HTML canvas

This repo accompanies a series of posts on the [VectorLogic
blog](https://vector-logic.com/blog/posts) which comprise a
tutorial on building a simple browser-based drawing tool 
using only native HTML canvas capabilities.

The tutorial is separated into four parts (only partially completed, at
present):
1. Draw free hand lines on the canvas
